##Final problem 1 for PHYS2200
####Volume of 5-dimensional superellipsoids

This problem asked for the volume of superellipsoids in 5D space using Monte Carlo integration.
|X1|^n+|X2|^n+|X3|^n+|X4|^n+|X5|^n = 1

* **Volume Vs Parameter n**

As n increases, the superellipsoid becomes smoother. The graph shows that as parameter n increases the volume of the superellipsoid approaches the 32, which is the volume of the 5D space boundry. The calculation time of each parameter n is significant, so the problem only asks to calculate up to n=9.
