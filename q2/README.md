##Final problem 2 for PHYS2200
####Oscillation of a rigid pendulum

This problem asked for the dimensionless frequency that a rigid pendulum looses its upright oscillation.

d(phi)/d(tau) = x

dx/d(tau) = -(1-a/l * omega^2 sin(omega tau))sin(phi)        

a/l = 0.01

phi(0) = 0.99*pi phi'(0) = 0

* **Stable and Unstable oscillation**

This graph shows the stable oscillation of a rigid pendulum at a dimensionless frequency of 200. The pendulum oscillates around a angle value of 3.14, which represents the up direction. As this frequency is lowered the pedulum will eventually lose its stability and begin rotating as shown in this graph.

This graph shows the unstable oscillation of a rigid penulum at a dimensionless frequency of 100. This frequency is not enough to keep the pendulum suspended.

Through trial and error I found that the pendulum looses its stability between 144 and 145. I did this by reducing the frequency by 10 until the pendulum becomes unstable then reducing frequency by 1 to narrow it down.
